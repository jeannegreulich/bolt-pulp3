# NOTE: Something about the repository at https://yum.puppet.com/puppet6
# prevents Pulp mirrors from fetching its RPM artifacts 99% of the time.
#
# As a workaround, all Puppet RPMs currently include a `direct_url` to a
# specific package/version.  This prevents Pulp from mirroring the upstream
# repo at all, and works like the old `packages.yaml` process.
#
# NOTE NOTE: While using direct_urls (and no Remote mirror), Pulp won't be able
# to auto-resolve these RPMs to the best available versions or obey
# constraints.  Make sure these are kept these up to date with new releases!
